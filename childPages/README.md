Comp progaming.
My name is Ali Hennawi, I am currently 15 years old. I attend Queen Elizabeth High School. I live in Edmonton, Alberta. I like to use computers and would like to get better at programming as the world is slowly letting computers and programming take over. I live in Edmonton, Alberta. I am in family of five, including an older brother and younger sister, named Mahmoud and Yasmeen. I enjoy playing basketball with friends as a hobby
